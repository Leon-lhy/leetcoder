## 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:

begin to intersect at node c1.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

 

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
```

 

**Example 3:**

[![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_3.png)](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_3.png)

```
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: null
Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```

 

**Notes:**

- If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.
- The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
- You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
- Each value on each linked list is in the range `[1, 10^9]`.
- Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.



#### 思路

走投无路走别人的路，知道相遇为止

前一种没有考虑无交点的情况，会造成死循环

```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        ListNode ha = headA, hb = headB;
        while(ha != hb){
            // ha = (ha.next == null ? headB : ha.next);
            // hb = (hb.next == null ? headA : hb.next);
            
            ha = (ha == null) ? headB : ha.next;
            hb = (hb == null) ? headA : hb.next;
        }
        
        return ha;
    }
}
```



#### 思路

先分别求长度，然后长的提前走两个链表差的长度

```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        ListNode ha = headA, hb = headB;
        int lena = 0, lenb = 0;
        while(ha != null){
            ha = ha.next;
            lena++;
        }
        
        while(hb != null){
            hb = hb.next;
            lenb++;
        }
        
        ha = headA;
        hb = headB;
        if(lena > lenb){
            int len = lena - lenb;
            while(len != 0){
                len--;
                ha = ha.next;
            }
        }else{
            int len = lenb - lena;
            while(len != 0){
                len--;
                hb = hb.next;
            }
        }
        
        while(ha != hb){
            ha = ha.next;
            hb = hb.next;
        }
        
        return ha;
    }
}
```
