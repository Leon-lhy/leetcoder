## 435. Non-overlapping Intervals

Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

 

**Note:**

1. You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
2. Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.



首先按照左边界，从小到大排序，如果后一个start < 前一个end，就说明没有overlap，继续传递。反之，结果++，又因为要返回最小值，所以右边界要尽可能小，所以将右边界小的再进行传递



```java
class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        if(intervals == null || intervals.length <= 1) return 0;
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (l1, l2) -> (l1[0] - l2[0]));
        
        int[] cur = intervals[0];
        int res = 0;
        
        for(int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++){
            if(intervals[i][0] >= cur[1]){
                cur = intervals[i];
            }else{
                res++;
                if(intervals[i][1] > cur[1]){
                    continue;
                }else{
                    cur = intervals[i];
                }
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
}
```
