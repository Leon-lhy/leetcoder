## 141. Linked List Cycle

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

快慢指针。注意nullpointer的处理。

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        if(head == null) return false;
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head.next;
        
        while(slow != fast){
            if(fast == null || fast.next == null) return false;
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```
